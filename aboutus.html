        <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>We are STEM students enrolled at Saint Michael College of Caraga, proudly identifying ourselves as a group known as "SINIGENGGENG." Our group is composed of five dedicated members who share a passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As a whole, we bring together our skills and knowledge in creating a website that mirrors our dedication as students in STEM and as Michaelinians. <br> <br> <br>

                        The name "SINIGENGGENG" reflects not only our unity but also our unique identity. Each letter represents a crucial aspect of our group, symbolizing our commitment to Support, Inspire, Nurture, Innovate, Grow, Engage, Network, and Generate Excellence in the fields of STEM. <br> <br> <br>
                        
                        Being STEM enthusiasts, we constantly strive and advocate for academic excellence;  hence why our educational website can serve as a guiding light for our fellow students to further expand their knowledge in the field of Earth Science.</p>
