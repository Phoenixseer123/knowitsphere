                    <p> 
                        The Atmosphere

The Atmosphere is the thin gaseous layer that envelopes the lithosphere. The present atmosphere is composed of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 0.9% Argon, and trace amount of gases.  <br> <br>

A significant process that occurs in our Atmosphere is called the Atmospheric Circulation. It is one of the most important processes in which the thermal energy of our Earth's surface is redistributed. Additionally, the Earth's atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant.  <br> <br>

The Atmosphere contains 5 crucial parts:  <br> <br>

1. Troposphere - The lowest part of Earth's atmosphere is called the troposphere. The troposphere contains between 75 and 80 percent of the atmosphere's mass. It is where most cloud kinds are found, and this layer is where nearly all weather happens. Lastly, it is the wettest layer by far in the atmosphere.  <br> <br>

2. Stratosphere - It is the second layer of the atmosphere as you go upward. The troposphere, the lowest layer, is right below the stratosphere. It is the second layer of the atmosphere as you go upward. The troposphere, the lowest layer, is right below the stratosphere  <br> <br>

3. Mesosphere - The mesosphere lies between the thermosphere and the stratosphere. “Meso” means middle, and this is the highest layer of the atmosphere in which the gases are all mixed up rather than being layered by their mass. If you have ever seen a shooting star before, that is actually a meteor burning up in the presence of the mesosphere.  <br> <br>

4. Thermosphere - It is the hottest layer in the Atmosphere due to it being responsible for absorbing highly energetic heat from the sun. Temperatures can climb sharply in the lower thermosphere (below 200 to 300 km altitude). Solar activity strongly influences temperature in the thermosphere.  <br> <br>

5. Exosphere - The Exosphere is the uppermost region of the Earth's atmosphere and has no clear upper boundary since it gradually fades into outer space. Some scientists don't believe that the Exosphere is still a part of our atmosphere due to it being practically in space, however, some still do.  <br> <br>
