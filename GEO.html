                <h1>The Geosphere</h1>
                    <p> 
                        From molten rock and heavy metals in the planet's center to sand on beaches and mountain tops, the geosphere is made up of all the rocks and minerals that may be found on Earth. 

                        Apart from the different components that make up the geosphere, it is also about the various processes that shape the Earth's surface. One of the essential processes that occur in the geosphere is the rock cycle, which involves a series of processes such as metamorphism, melting and solidification, weathering, erosion, deposition, and burial. <br> <br>
                        
                        These processes are responsible for the continuous recycling of rocks on Earth between sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic states. Through this process, rocks are transformed from one form to another, and the minerals and elements they contain are redistributed across the Earth's surface. Understanding these complex processes is vital for predicting and managing the Earth's resources and mitigating the impact of human activities on the environment. <br> <br>

                    • Sedimentary rocks are formed via weathering and transport of existing rocks and then deposition, cementation, and compaction into sedimentary rock. <br> <br>
                    • Igneous rocks are the cooling and crystallization of molten rock forms igneous rocks. <br> <br>
                    • Metamorphic rocks are formed when heat or pressure is applied to other rocks
