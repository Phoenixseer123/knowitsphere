                <h1>The Earth's Subsystems</h1>
                    <p> 
                        The Earth comprises four different subsystems; each with its own significance in shaping our planet's identity and purpose, namely, GEOSPHERE, HYDROSPHERE, ATMOSPHERE, BIOSPHERE. These four subsystems are called "spheres". They work together in order to keep our planet stable and properly functioning. <br> <br>

                        These spheres are interconnected by processes and cycles, with three of those spheres being Abiotic (substances that are made from non-living materials), and Biotic (living things like bacteria, birds, mammals, insects, and plants).  <br> <br> 



                    </p>

                    <h1>Earth Science for a Change</h1>
                    <p> 
                        Putting ourselves in the world of Science, we are able to unlock more knowledge and answers about the Earth and its complexity. When studying it, we are able to address global challenges and foster social change. <br> <br> Thus, being familiar with Earth Science, or the Earth's subsystems in particular, we are able to gain awareness of the natural problems our planet may face; Climate Change Awareness, Natural Disaster Preparedness, Resource Management, Environmental Conservation, and many more.
